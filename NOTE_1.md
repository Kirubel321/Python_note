## Variable

#### Variables are containers for storing data values.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
```
Example:
  x = 5
  y = "John"
  print(x)
  print(y)
```
Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
```
Example:
  x = 4       # x is of type int
  x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
  print(x)
```

## Data Types
